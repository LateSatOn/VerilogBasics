# Verilog Workshop

This repository contains materials for a Verilog workshop divided into three parts:

## Part 1: Basic Logic

This section covers the fundamentals of Verilog and digital logic design. Topics include:

- Logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc.)
- Combinational circuits
- Writing and running basic testbenches

## Part 2: FSM Basics

This section introduces finite state machines (FSMs) and sequential logic. Topics include:

- Moore and Mealy state machines
- State Diagrams
- Case statements
- Using clock and reset signals

## Part 3: ALU Basics

This section focuses on constructing a simple 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). Topics include:

- Modular ALU design (add, subtract, bitwise operations)
- ALU control logic
- Top-level integration
- Writing and verifying testbenches

## Requirements

- Verilog simulator (e.g., Icarus Verilog)
- Optional: GTKWave for waveform viewing
- A text editor or IDE that supports Verilog (e.g., VSCode)

## How to Use

Each part contains Verilog modules and corresponding testbenches. You can compile and simulate the designs using your preferred Verilog simulator.

Refer to the comments in each file for instructions and explanations.
